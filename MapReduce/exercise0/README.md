# MapReduce - (Very) First Example
## MR (Super) Simple (and super useless)



The "Hello World" of Big Data is Word Count... so, let's count the words of a file.

Via command line:

`wc input.txt`

It will return [LINES] [WORDS] [CHARACTERS]

But... this is not what we want. We want to count how many times the same word is written

`chmod +x mapper.py`

Once its an executable we can run  it as

`./mapper.py < input.txt`

Not very useful, uh? Let's move to the [Next Exercise](../exercise1)
