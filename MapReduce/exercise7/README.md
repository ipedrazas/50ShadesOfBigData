# Top 10 stories

Imagine your boss comes one day and gives you 30 thousand erotic stories and one simple request: "Make a book with the best 30 stories".

This is a very common question with a very subjective answer. How do you rate stories? How do you create a subjective ranking?

One approach that probably would not please your boss wuld be to read all the stories,

## Calculate the erotic load of a story

The process of creating a subjective metric is a bit of a trial and error one. The idea is to create a model and play around with the different variables to see how well fits our plan.

In this case we're going to sort the stories by their erotic load. Of course there's no such thing as the erotic load of a story, but it's a metric that we want to create.  Why? Imagine that you have been asigned to create a book with the most erotic stories of these websites. Well, how do you approach such task?

You could just select some of them based on your preferences or you could say that your expertise allows you to filter straight away which story is good (or in this case, which story has a large erotic load) or not.

Another option, our option, is to create a model that will allow us to sort stories according to the variables that our model contains.
